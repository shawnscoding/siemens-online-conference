# Achievement

### Beacuse the project ended very successfully, We have earned their trust and concluded three additional contracts with them.

### I learned how to lead a project while working in this project.

I was able to understand what's important job for Project Leader apart from development. As a leader, no matter waht your speciality it is, you need to spend a lot of time talking to clients and project members. This includes reviewing client's requirement, communicate with team members and other departments to find out if there is an issue in the process. For me, everytime our project manager added new functionality needed to be implemented to the proposal, I had to deeply think through if this is feasible and could be done by the deadline. If there's an issue to the requirement, I have to explain about the issue and suggest a solution. I didn't realise how massive responsibility a leader has before the begin of this project. Although all of the wokrs I was required to do was unfamiliar and overwhelming at the begining, my productivity could increase little by little everytime I solved a variety of issues. And the more we undertood each other's workflow, the easier it became to collaborate. I hgihly believe I learned and grew significantly from the experience. 

<!-- 여러상황에서 문제를 해결하면서 
사람들과 많은 소통을 하면서 생산력이 ㅎ증가했다.


본 프로젝트에서 개발 PL(project Leader)로 활동하면서 PL의 역할에 대해 깊게 이해할 수 있었습니다. 본 직위는 개발과 더불어 많은 시간 고객 그리고 기획팀과 소통을 해야합니다. 기획서를 검토하며 명시된 내용들이 기술적으로 혹은 일정내로 구현 가능한지 빠르게 검토해야하며 만약 이슈가 있다면 이슈에 대해서 명확히 설명하고 이에 대한 방안을 제시할 수 있어야합니다. 리더로써 프로젝트를 이끌어가는 것은 분명 쉬운 일이 아니었습니다. 하지만 여러 에로사항을 해결하며 많은 것을 배울 수 있었으며 팀원들과 의견을 주고받으며 일의 효율성을 증가시켰습니다.
